###A configurable and fully-featured chat application server

#What it is
ChatPi is a configurable and fully-featured chat application server that is capable on running on any kind of hardware, including the RaspberryPi B+. This project allows you to run a full-featured chat server on your own LAN network that you can use for your family or your business. This application was tested on the Raspberry Pi, so in theory you can have a fully-featured 35$ chat server setup that costs pennies a month to run.
